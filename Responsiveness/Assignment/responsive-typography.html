            <h1>Responsive Typography with Clamp</h1>
            <p>Typography plays a crucial role in web design. Using the clamp() function, we can create fluid typography that scales smoothly across different screen sizes. This approach ensures optimal readability on all devices, from mobile phones to large desktop monitors. The clamp() function takes three parameters: minimum size, preferred size (using viewport units), and maximum size.</p>
