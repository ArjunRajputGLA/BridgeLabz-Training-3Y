            <p class="intro">
                Typography is one of the most important aspects of web design. It affects readability, user experience, and the overall aesthetic of a website. Good typography creates hierarchy, establishes tone, and guides readers through content.

                <strong>Font families</strong> play a crucial role in setting the mood of your content. Serif fonts convey tradition and reliability, while sans-serif fonts feel modern and clean. The <mark>choice of font</mark> can significantly impact how your message is received.

                <em>Letter spacing and line height</em> are essential for readability. Proper spacing prevents text from feeling cramped and allows the reader's eyes to flow naturally through the content. These subtle adjustments can make a dramatic difference in user experience.

                Font weight and size create <strong>visual hierarchy</strong>, helping readers understand which information is most important. By combining different weights and sizes, designers can <mark>guide attention</mark> and improve comprehension of complex information.

                Text alignment affects how content is perceived. Left-aligned text is easiest to read for long passages, while center alignment works well for headings and short pieces. The key is to maintain <em>consistency and balance</em> throughout your design.
